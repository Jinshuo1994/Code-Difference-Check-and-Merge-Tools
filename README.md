Code Difference Check and Merge Tools
=========================================================

This is my personal hobby project inspired by [the awesome articles][] written by James. 
Thanks to the clear explanation of *Myers diff algorithm*, I managed to understand and implement the algorithm in JavaScript.

Furthermore, I want to build an online **code difference check and merge** website because I used that kind of tools a lot in the past.
However, few of the websites have the feature of easily merging differences.

Most of the code will be written in Javascript. After deployment, the website link will be added here.
